# CSK API

An API server that serves info for Chennai Student Kondattam 2020

It is a backend only server, no front end

On the back-end,

- app starts at `server.js`
- db connectivity is in `db.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy.

## Made by CSK Team

This is a product of many TFI fellows working for Chennai Student Kondattam 2020.
